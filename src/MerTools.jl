### Counting Mers

"""
A simple mer count struct.

MerCount is a simple struct that binds a mer value to a count of the number
of times it has been observed. This type, (sorted) vectors of them, and some
additional utility methods, form the basic building blocks of the higher-level
mer counting functionality of the MerTools sub-module. 

!!! note
    The count is stored as an UInt8 because often once the count is more than
    255 we hardly care anymore.

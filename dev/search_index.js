Sequences are contained in nodes, and the distances are represented by links.\n\nA singe node represents a sequence and its reverse complement. Every node has a correlative ID starting from 1. For every node X in the graph, the negative ID -X is mapped to the reverse complement of X. This mapping is virtual: Only one node is stored in the graph. This is because every node has an orientaton: Each node has a positive end (+), and a negative end (-). So when a node is accessed with (or traversed by entering) the positive end the node yields the stored sequence. Conversely, when a node is accessed with (or traversed by entering) the negative end the node yelds the reverse complement of the stored sequence. In this way the positive end can be thought of as the sequence start, and the negative end can be thought of as the sequence end.\n\nA single distance between two sequences is represented as a single link. Every link connects two node ends and contains a distance (they take the form ([+, -]n1, [+, -]n2, [+, -]dist)). A link connects two node ends, and so the order of the signed nodes in the links does not change the link. If the distance in a link is negative, this represents an overlap between two sequences. These overlaps must be \"perfect overlaps\".\n\nThis SequenceDistanceGraph type is only intended to be interacted with directly by developers and people who know what they are doing.
